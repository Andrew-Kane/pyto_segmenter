# pyto_segmenter

## NOTE: 
###THIS PROJECT IS IN EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT CURRENTLY PREPARED FOR DISTRIBUTION. IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN USING THE CODE IN THIS PROJECT IN THE SHORT TERM, I RECOMMEND CONTACTING ME DIRECTLY.

This in-development module is intended for segmenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells (or other roughly elliptical cells) using the signal from a cytosolically-localized fluorescent protein in fluorescence microscopy z-stacks. It is not perfect, and segmented cells require pruning post-hoc to eliminate poorly segmented cells (~20-50% when cells are present in a single layer, more otherwise).
