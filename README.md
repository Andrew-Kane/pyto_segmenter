This in-development module is intended for segmenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells (or other roughly elliptical cells) using the signal from a cytosolically-localized fluorescent protein in fluorescence microscopy z-stacks. It is not perfect, and segmented cells require pruning post-hoc to eliminate poorly segmented cells (~20-50% when imaged cells are present in a single layer, more otherwise).
